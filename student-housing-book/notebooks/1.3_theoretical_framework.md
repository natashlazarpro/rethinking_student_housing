# 1.3 Theoretical Framework

Theoretical framework can be seen as a point of view of to research question. In order to make research interdisciplinary it is a need to consider urban and social theories. While there are many theories that could help to solve the student housing crisis in Berlin, this chapter examines only three main theories that respond to literature gaps and influenced the forming of research interest.  

## Urban Theories 

**Central Place Theory**

Central Place Theory helps to construct spatial research at the level of a large city such as Berlin, as well as at the level of its planning districts, defining urban centrality:

`For many economic activities located in a city it is important that they be central to some larger market area that extends beyond the boundaries of the urban place itself. This is especially so for activities that serve the community surrounding the urban place` (King, 1986).  

This theory can be adapted to the student housing crisis by considering universities as central points that establish spatial economic relations in the student housing market.

Central Place Theory, considering universities as central places, helps to unite the existing Berlin student real estate market and the universities that form the demand for this market. Depending on the ownership of student accommodation, the theory helps to define the roles of both the private and public construction sectors. 

Thus, the economic interrelationships between higher education universities and student accommodation come sharply into focus when, for example, policy issues concerning metropolitan and regional government reorganisation are raised. 

## Social Theories 

**Right to the City Theory**   

Right to the City Theory is a necessary response to the financialisation that has taken place in Berlin over the past decades. 

The concept of Right to the City, developed by French philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre, is a critical approach to understanding social relations in the modern city (Lefebvre, 1996). Lefebvre argues that the city is not just a physical space, but a product of social relations where residents have an unconditional collective right to urban life. Lefebvre’s concept allows us to rethink the student housing crisis from the perspective of social justice, accessibility, and commercialisation.

`The future of the city must be shaped by its inhabitants, not by the interests of capital.` (Lefebvre, 1968).

Berlin’s urban environment must take into account the needs of all inhabitants, not just the economically privileged groups. Students are an important part of the urban population, providing a driver of change in the city. Every student has the right to social justice. Factors influencing students’ housing choices should be taken into account in Berlin’s long-term urban planning.

`The city is an oeuvre, closer to a work of art than a simple material product.` (Lefebvre, 1968).

The housing market in Berlin should be shaped by social demands and not by commercial interests. The city is not an object of speculation. Prioritising private development over the creation
of new affordable housing contradicts the student’s right to the city.

In Berlin, this theory is particularly relevant and has actually been written into the city constitution: 

`Everyone has the right to adequate housing. The state promotes the creation and provision of adequate housing, especially for people on low incomes, and the cultivation of condominium ownership` – Article 28 (1) of the [Berlin Constitution](https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/the-governing-mayor/the-constitution-of-berlin/artikel.16538.php).

This theory aims to protect students' rights to affordable housing, counteract the displacement of students from the central urban fabric, and halt the privatisation of social housing.  


**Affordability Theory**
Affordability Theory complements spatial and social analysis with an economic dimension of housing affordability. The main problem with student housing in Berlin is not only a shortage of supply, but also the fact that prices are out of line with students' actual financial capabilities.

The Affordability Theory in Housing, developed by Michael Stone (2006), defines affordability beyond rental prices, incorporating income, basic needs expenses, transport costs, and structural limitations of the housing market. Stone’s theory allows us to define affordable housing in a broader economic and social context.

`Housing affordability is not just about the cost of housing, but about the balance between housing costs and the ability to meet other basic needs.` (Stone, 2006). 

The assessment of housing affordability for students should include not only the cost of housing itself and its proportion in relation to the student’s income but also the cost of studying at Berlin’s universities, as well as basic financial needs such as transport, student insurance, and groceries. In addition to basic financial needs, the term affordability also includes basic social needs such as the quality of housing, the state of the infrastructure, and the possibility for students to participate in urban life. Student housing affordability is the ability to cover housing costs without compromising basic financial and social needs.

Affordability Theory serves as a conceptual basis for analysing student housing needs and preferences and requires a behavioural and qualitative approach. Thus, it complements the quantitative spatial research of Central Place Theory with a qualitative assessment of the actual living conditions of students, revealing the gap between formal housing supply and actual affordability.

Together, Central Place Theory, Right to the City Theory, and Affordability Theory form a comprehensive analytical framework that allows us to view the student housing crisis in Berlin as a spatial, social, and economic problem simultaneously. These theories provide a theoretical basis for data-driven analysis aimed at reducing the gap between the opportunities offered by the student housing market and the real needs of students in the context of the ongoing housing crisis.
