# 1.4 Rethinking Student Housing in Berlin

# Problem Statement

Housing is a basic human need and a fundamental right, comparable in importance to access to water or clean air (Lefebvre, 1968). Stable, affordable and safe housing is a necessary condition for a dignified life, social integration and full participation in urban and educational spaces. In this context, housing should be viewed not only as physical infrastructure, but also as a socio-political tool that shapes access to opportunities, resources and rights.

As Roberta Burghardt (2025) notes, architects, urban planners and designers can influence not only the form of living spaces, but also models of ownership, participation schemes, and mechanisms for managing and allocating housing. Thus, the issue of student housing goes beyond the design of buildings and becomes part of a broader discussion about urban justice and governance.

# Context 
Historically, in the post-war period, students in Berlin mainly lived in shared rental accommodation. However, over the last few decades, the structure of student housing has changed significantly. Purpose-Built Student Accommodations (PBSA) — specially built and managed residential complexes for students — have begun to play a special role, which is particularly noticeable in the international student segment.

Nevertheless, despite the growth in the number of such facilities, only about 8% of students in Berlin live in PBSA (Deutsches Studierendenwerk, 2024). Most students are still forced to look for accommodation on the general rental market — in shared flats, sublets or corporate models — due to the general rental pattern of the German housing market. As a result, students compete with other population groups for a limited number of available flats, leading to rising prices, housing instability and housing vulnerability. 

The process of financialisation of student housing reinforces this imbalance: PBSAs are viewed by investors as stable investment products with high returns, due to the lack of sufficient alternatives in the public sector. As a result, the social function of student housing is taking a step back, making way for market logic (Annas Ejaz, Anika Gercke, 2025).

# Limitations 
At the same time, a variety of challenges are already looming that the city will have to overcome in the coming years. Above all, these include tasks associated with urban growth. According to the Senate Department for Urban Development, Building and Housing (2022), Berlin already reached a population of 3.75 million. The population forecast assumes that the number of residents will rise to around 3.93 million by 2030. The growth is primarily driven by immigration from abroad (Housing Market Report, 2024). Such residents accounted for 24.4 percent of Berlin’s population in 2024. The number of newcomers who moved to Berlin from abroad was twice as high as the number of people who moved to the capital from other parts of Germany.  

Berlin's housing policy stipulates that at least 30% of new housing must be social housing, with the aim of preserving social diversity and housing affordability in all areas of the city (Senate Department for Urban Development, Building and Housing, 2023). However, this target has not yet been sufficiently achieved in the area of student housing.

As ESN and ESU (2023) emphasise, expanding public student housing should be a priority across Europe, especially in countries and cities where it is underdeveloped. Such housing plays a key role not only in ensuring affordability, but also in supporting the internationalisation and mobility of students. Higher education institutions, as important urban actors, should engage more actively with local authorities and the private sector, as many of the challenges faced by students are not only market-related but also involve contractual and administrative barriers, where the public sector can play a decisive role.

The study focuses exclusively on international students and purpose-built student accommodation, which allows for a deeper understanding of the current structural vulnerabilities of this model, but limits the ability to generalise the results to the entire student population.

# Research Question

**How can data-driven decision-making reshape Berlin's student housing, to bridge the gaps between student housing market capacities and students demands, addressing basic financial and social needs, during the city's ongoing housing crisis?**


# Scientific Objectives
In accordance with the question posed, the study has the following scientific objectives: 

1. Student Housing Market: Capacities, Demand, and Spatial Distribution
**Where are student accommodations and universities located?**

**How are they spatially distributed across the city?**

2. Student Housing Market Imbalance
**How do student university demand compare to student housing market housing capacities?**

**Where do spatial patterns of demand and supply generate elevated market pressure?**

3. Students Behind the Numbers 
**Who are the users of student accommodations?**

**What experience they have in ongoing housing crisis? What are common needs, preferences, difficulties and problems?**

The study aims to combine spatial, quantitative and qualitative analysis to go beyond abstract market indicators. The use of geodata and statistics allows us to identify areas of increased pressure and structural imbalances, while surveys and interviews reveal the everyday experiences of students that are hidden behind aggregated data. This combined approach not only identifies housing shortages, but also understands how they translate into stress, unstable housing strategies, discriminatory practices and social vulnerability, especially among international students. Ultimately, the goal of the study is to form a basis for more equitable and informed decisions in the field of student housing, taking into account the real needs of users and the constraints of the urban context.
