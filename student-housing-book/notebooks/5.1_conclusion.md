# 5.1 Conclusion 

I attempted to combine spatial, quantitative, and qualitative aspects to rethink the student housing crisis in Berlin and came up with the following conclusions: 

1. Public student accommodations are more evenly distributed across the periphery, reflecting their role as affordable, welfare-oriented infrastructure. Private facilities are more concentrated in central areas and high-demand areas, particularly in Mitte, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, reflecting market logic that prioritises profitable locations with high rents over equal access.

2. East Berlin shows a high concentration of large student complexes and compact clusters. Western Berlin, on the other hand, is characterised by a predominance of stable areas with low capacity and a shortage of supply. 

3. Private universities are mainly concentrated in Mitte, Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg – areas that are already characterised by high demand for housing – while public universities occupy both central areas and more peripheral areas such as Lichtenberg, Steglitz-Zehlendorf and Treptow-Köpenick. 

4. Universities with high numbers of international students are not grouped geographically, but rather distributed in a fragmented manner and often separated from similar neighbors. The West Berlin traditionally concentrates international academic demand, while the East remains unattractive in an international context.

5. In the vast majority of university market areas, university international demand significantly exceeds available student accommodation capacity. 

6. Market pressure is not generated by individual market areas, but by the overlap of multiple accessibility zones, which explains why it is the concentration of university functions — and not just the local shortage of student accommodation.

7. Berlin have pronounced polycentricity of educational space: central locations at the highest levels concentrate the greatest student demand and form the main clusters of attraction, while lower-level zones perform supporting functions. At the same time, demand significantly exceeds supply at all levels. Thus, the analysis shows that the student housing crisis in Berlin has a clearly defined spatial structure. 

8. Student accommodation in Berlin serves a wider range of educational tracks. A significant proportion of users university students, including preparatory undergraduates, college students, postgraduates, exchange students, interns, young research workers and teaching staff. 

9. The affordability of rent is highly rated, reflecting students’ adaptation to financial constraints or forced compromises when choosing accommodation. The location and proximity to universities reflecting the spatial gap between places of study and actual areas of residence for students. In other words students priorities affordability over proximity to university. 

10. The housing crisis in Berlin has a systemic and multi-level impact on students’ lives, significantly limiting their choices and undermining their sense of stability. High prices and intense competition dramatically narrow the range of available options, making even minimally acceptable housing difficult to obtain. The crisis has a particularly acute impact on students’ psychological and emotional state. The search for housing is described as an exhausting and demanding process that takes priority over studying and social life. The housing crisis creates an atmosphere of constant instability and forced gratitude for minimally acceptable conditions. 

In a broader context, these findings imply that the student housing crisis in Berlin is not a temporary market failure or the result of individual student decisions. Rather, it is the result of institutional and political priorities that have placed social student housing secondary to the investment logic of urban development. The spatial structure of the crisis points to a systemic mismatch between education policy, migration dynamics and urban housing planning.

The polycentric structure of Berlin's educational space, with demand concentrated in central areas and insufficient supply of affordable housing at all levels, demonstrates a lack of coordinated policy between universities, senates and housing operators. Universities continue to increase their international student enrolment without accompanying this growth with an equivalent expansion of public housing infrastructure. As a result, responsibility for student accommodation is effectively shifted to the private market, which operates on the logic of profit maximisation rather than equal access.

Particularly problematic is the fact that purpose-built student accommodation, despite being formally positioned as a solution to the crisis, reinforces social selection and spatial inequality. The concentration of private halls of residence in central and prestigious areas does not reduce overall market pressure but, on the contrary, contributes to rising rents and the displacement of socially vulnerable groups. Thus, private purpose-built student accommodation functions more as an investment asset than as an element of social housing policy, which contradicts Berlin's stated goals of providing affordable housing.

At the city policy level, this points to the need to rethink the role of student housing as critical social infrastructure rather than a niche segment of the real estate market. The research data shows that without active public sector involvement — through the expansion of state-owned student housing, regulation of private operators, and the integration of housing into educational and spatial planning — the crisis will continue and deepen. This particularly affects international students, for whom the lack of stable housing is directly linked to their legal status, access to registration and the ability to participate fully in city life.

In a political sense, the student housing crisis is becoming an indicator of a broader problem—the crisis of accessibility in the city as such. Limited choices, the normalisation of temporary and unstable forms of housing, increased psychological stress, and forced gratitude for minimally acceptable conditions all point to the gradual loss of the city as an inclusive space. This calls into question the implementation of the Right to the City principle and requires a shift from reactive measures to a long-term, structural strategy in which students are seen not as temporary users of the city, but as its rightful residents.
