  abstract = {This article explores how notions of formality and informality in housing are produced in relation to digital infrastructure and localized bordering regimes. Drawing on a research diary project conducted with ``International'' migrants in Berlin, Germany, I draw on scholarship in Digital Geography and Migration Studies to frame digital platforms as ``arrival infrastructures,'' which allow ``Internationals'' to negotiate the legal process of becoming formally resident in the city. Rather than entry into the long-term ``formal,'' rental sector, the opportunity to codify residency status becomes the decisive factor in determining housing choices. It also determines the type of housing platforms which are used to seek accommodation in the city and influences digital behavior. My contribution in this article is twofold. Firstly, I advance an understanding of housing in/formality as a concept which is formed according to one's own positionality in relation to State mobility regimes. Secondly, I describe how the interface of platform-mediated rental sites becomes a site of knowledge production about norms and behavior within an unfamiliar housing system. This is accomplished through the proposal of a typology which classifies platform services according to the ways in which they used to negotiate residency governance regimes: large and long-term housing platforms; ``medium-term'' platform-mediated rentals; platforms rented and shared; and supplementary tools. I conclude by highlighting the need for further research into the role of rental platforms as a bordering technology, especially in the European context.},

  abstract = {The shortage of student housing in Western Europe and the high demand for student population indicate the potential of the impetus for more sustainable and better quality accommodation. The residential building sector is one of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet appropriate criteria for the assessment of student housing do not exist. Decisions to evaluate student housing are still primarily based on rental cost or anecdotal evidence when assessing their performance and living quality. Multi-objective criteria are needed to assist with the selection of sustainable student housing for higher education institutions students. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to identify key performance indicators for assessing sustainable student housing, and to develop a simple tool for the selection and measurement of the sustainability of student housing. The overarching aim is to improve the quality and sustainability of student accommodation in Europe. The methodology is based on a mixed-method research approach comprising a literature review on rating systems, a survey questionnaire with 610 student respondents, and a ranking analysis acquired from the severity index calculation. A total of 44 key performance indicators were identified, and a simple interactive tool was developed and tested. The proposed tool is demonstrated using a case study with two students as the decision-makers. The tool provides a novel approach to assess student housing. This creates an opportunity for a pan European environmental policy and an increase in market competitiveness to attract European and overseas students.},

Design/methodology/approach               The study adopted mixed-methods research approach. An online survey of 975 public and private university students experience on room selection prior to school re-opening in Ghana was used. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multiple regression model (MRM) were used to estimate the satisfaction of using online websites and word-of-mouth strategies (renting housing based on personal recommendation) on student room pricing and building services availability. Telephone interviews were further used to support the results of EFA and MRM.                                         Findings               The study reveals that most students were satisfied with the word-of-mouth strategy than online review marketing strategy for room selection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, online student housing review marketing strategy provided higher rent which did not reflect the services available. Furthermore, students were more interested in the nature of rooms, lavatories and kitchen in their choice of room than availability of internet, study area, television (TV) room and gym center.                                         Practical implications               The study suggest that student housing managers require to market their facilities as-it-is than to use one room as an advertising justification for all rooms which does not usually provide a true reflection of the existing situation of room. Again, housing which rely on online marketing strategies need to provide compensation for students who feel they have been misled by their advertisement.                                         Originality/value               The provision of compensation to students and availability of COVID-19 protection measures determine student room selection. Asides, the introduction of online marketing strategies in student housing in sub-Saharan student housing market is new, and, consequently, this study on it is a novelty.},

Through secondary analysis of separate primary research projects, we explore financialisation's impact on tenants, neighbourhoods, and urban space. Despite their contrasting market contexts and investor strategies, financialisation heightened existing inequalities in housing affordability and stability, and rearranged spaces of abandonment and gentrification in both cities. Conversely cities themselves also shaped the process of financialisation, with weakened rental protections providing an opening to transform affordable housing into a new global asset class. We also show how financialisation's adaptability in the face of changing market conditions entails ongoing, but shifting processes of uneven development. Comparative studies of financialisation can help highlight geographically disparate, but similar exposures to this global process, thus contributing to a critical urban politics of finance that crosses boundaries of space, sector and scale.},

  abstract = {The role of student housing within social infrastructure provision is arguably overlooked. This is a vital issue, as purpose-built student accommodation provides a significant stock of affordable accommodation for students in European university cities while also supporting their social integration in the urban environment. Although an increasing involvement of for-profit student home developers and providers has been diversifying the landscape of student housing across European university cities in the last decade, this change has been mainly associated with the internationalisation of students' mobility and the financialisation processes driven by private investors. Subsequently, this article expands these supply and demand side perspectives by localising student housing as social infrastructure. Using Vienna as a case study, the authors mapped purpose-built student accommodation locations and conducted qualitative interviews to analyse recent changes in the provision of student housing and to discuss its implications for the social dimension of purpose-built student accommodation. Accordingly, the respective analysis identifies different logics of student housing providers concerning expansion plans and housing quality, which, in turn, affect the function of student housing as social infrastructure. As a result, this article emphasises the need to critically reflect on the overlooked role of student housing as social infrastructure and the role of public actors as well as their policies in the financialisation of purpose-built student accommodation.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of 2023, rent prices have increased by more than 7\% in Germany. A closer look at the German housing rent index from 1995 to 2022 reveals that rents have become increasingly unaffordable, especially in most major German cities. While many individuals in German cities are experiencing an ongoing rent increase and housing shortage, students are a particularly vulnerable group suffering from the high costs of renting. We use data from The Student Survey in Germany (2021), a representative database to describe their situation. As this data shows, rent is the most essential expenditure item for students, with an average rent of 410 euros per month, accounting for nearly half of their monthly expenditures. This average, however, hides the fact that about 20\% of students have even higher monthly accommodation costs, paying over 500 euros. These higher rents may hinder specific student groups from studying, such as those without an academic family background, thereby reproducing social inequalities. These students might not be able to study at their desired higher education institutions, potentially leading to lower returns in future employment. Based on this, our contribution aims to evaluate the current housing situation of students in Germany with a particular focus on students without tertiary-educated parents.},

Berlin, Hamburg, Stockholm, and Gothenburg are all experiencing population growth and changing demographics; housing construction has lagged demand, leading to housing shortage and to increased housing costs. This article provides a detailed case study on institutional prerequisites and political strategies to increase affordable housing supply. The four cities focus on traditional housing policy tools: organisation, urban planning, land allocation, and subsidies. Affordable housing is promoted through targeted tools as well as policies aiming at increased housing supply elasticity. The German cities have come further than their Swedish peers in creating an active housing policy as they have clearer goals supported by influential politicians, and use more tools. A tentative explanation of the difference between the German and Swedish cities explored in this paper is that politicians in Berlin and Hamburg have greater incentives to promote housing construction because of the structure of their cities' housing markets.},

The analysis provides an overview of how students allocate themselves into five different types of housing, which are characterised by different up- and downsides. Some forms of housing, such as living with parents and student accommodation, that are of particular importance in different countries are analysed in greater depth. As the home is also a place of study, the question of the extent to which different forms of accommodation offer students access to sufficient internet connection and a quiet place to study is investigated. The chapter also analyses how different forms of housing affect the time students spend commuting between their home and their higher education institution.},

  abstract = {In 2020, Berlin introduced a rigorous rent-control policy responding to soaring prices by capping rents: the Mietendeckel (rent freeze). The German Constitutional Court revoked the policy only one year later. Although successful in lowering rents during its duration, the consequences for Berlin's rental market and close-by markets are per se not clear. This article evaluates the short-term causal supply-side effects in terms of prices, quantities, and landlords' strategic behavior. We develop a theoretical framework capturing the key features of first-generation rent control policies and Berlin-specific aspects. Using a rich pool of detailed rent advertisements, predictions are tested, and further empirical causal inference techniques are applied for comparing price trajectories of dwellings inside and outside the policy's scope. Mechanically, advertised rents drop significantly upon the policy's enactment. A substantial rent gap along Berlin's administrative border emerges, and rapidly growing rents in Berlin's (unregulated) adjacent municipalities are observed. Landlords started adopting a hedging strategy insuring themselves against the risk of contractually long-term fixed low rents following a potentially unconstitutional law. Whereas this hedge was beneficial for landlords, the risk was completely borne by tenants. Moreover, the number of available properties for rent dropped significantly, a share of which appears to be permanently lost for the rental sector. This hampers a successful housing search for first-time renters and people moving within the city. Overall, negative consequences for renters appear to outweigh positive ones.

In the meantime, returns are increased by ``optimising'' the housing stock. This includes constant rent increases, modernisation, administrative automation and the standardisation of operating procedures. The article examines the marketisation and financialisation of the non-profit housing stock after 1990. For this purpose, fundamental changes in the management of the (formerly) non-profit housing companies as well as the opening of the housing field for financial market actors -- made possible by financial market liberalisation -- are taken into account. This serves to analyse the implementation of new logics of exploitation in large financial market-based housing companies and their relationship to tenants, who have become passive customers.},

This paper applies future horizons instead of intended future plans to emphasize the open and uncertain nature of young adults' aspired future. Based on 15 biographical interviews and a survey to geographically contextualize these in terviews, the results show how rural young adults can have parallel future horizons to maintain several options open in which they all aim to preservea rural identity. This paper illustrates how rural young adults compromise a rural identity with aspirations elsewhere in a staying or rural horizon elsewhere. In addition, the results show how they deal with rural identitiesby further internalizing and externalizing their rural identities with variations of embracing aspects of a rural identity with regard to different future horizons. The paper concludes that young adults can be considered, however also out of uncertainty about the future, as active participants of their future who apply parallel and temporal horizons and still preserve a rural identity},

  abstract = {Academic tourism refers to travel activities in higher education contexts. This study has focused on the University of Barcelona (Spain) as an outbound market for international academic tourism. Three specific objectives were set to investigate the demographic profile of outgoing students, their tourist behaviour, and the impacts of their academic mobility. This mixed methods exploratory research entailed conducting a survey among a convenience sample of 70 outgoing students, whose responses were processed through descriptive and inferential SPSS statistical analyses. Additionally, a virtual focus group took place with 3 outgoing students and 3 members of staff from higher education international offices. Content analysis was carried out by means of QDA Miner Lite. The main results indicate that the major push factor was personal growth, followed by the search for new experiences, and linguistic-cultural development, while the principal pull factors were the local language, culture, and tourist attractions. Students mostly stayed at residence halls and rented apartments, used external catering services two or three times a week, and public transport was frequently used. Cultural, nightlife, and gastronomic activities were prioritised. For the majority, monthly expenditure on accommodation ranged between {\texteuro}200 and more than {\texteuro}800. Other additional expenses exceeded {\texteuro}200 for approximately half of our respondents, and nearly a third received some institutional financial support. Study-abroad sojourns enhanced students' autonomy, self-confidence, responsibility, self-knowledge, tolerance, open-mindedness, and knowledge of the local culture. The international mobility experience predominantly met and even surpassed the participants' previous expectations. In conclusion, our findings support the presumed sustainability of academic tourism in comparison to mass tourism. However, the limited representativeness of the sample must be acknowledged, so this study should be considered as a first step towards future expanded investigations.},

It studies the acceptance, motivation and side-effects of voluntarily reducing living space in five European Union countries: Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Spain and Sweden. Insights are derived from an extensive collection of qualitative empirical material collected from citizen and stakeholder `thinking labs' across the five case countries. Overall, the data reveal an initial reluctance among citizens to reduce living space voluntarily. They also point to some major structural barriers: the housing market and its regulatory framework, social inequality, or dominant societal norms regarding `the ideal home'. Enhanced community amenities can compensate for reduced private living space, though contingent upon a clear allocation of rights and responsibilities. Participants also reported positive effects to living smaller, including increased time for leisure activities and proximity to services. This was often coupled with urbanization, which may also be part of living smaller in the future. Policy relevance Despite many challenges, European Union citizens can accept and embrace smaller living, given the right conditions. In particular, meaningful social contacts, good shared amenities and attractive neighbourhoods can lead to high satisfaction with smaller living conditions. Urbanization can serve as a major driving force to achieve this transformation, but it must be guided. Policy interventions are necessary to ensure a changing housing stock and more flexible use of the existing housing stock. Support for downsizing necessitates a reconfiguration of regulatory norms and economic incentives for building and planning. Equally important, `soft' values of good community and mutual respect need to be fostered in a denser, smaller housing reality. Good governance becomes essential for housing to allow for flexibility in living situations and to manage conflicts. A shift in norms and values towards community and sharing is necessary and this requires active policymaking and good governance of urban spaces.},

  year = 2023,
  abstract = {This paper is dedicated to the study of student housing using the example of Aachen, Germany's seventhlargest student city with 61,500 students. The focus lies on the current satisfaction of students with affordable dormitories. New needs and requests for future development are analyzed. The market for student housing is tense. Between 2002 and 2022, the number of students in Germany increased from 1.9 million to 2.9 million. At the same time, the social infrastructure, especially housing, has not grown at a similar rate. More and more private investors are entering the market and exploiting the shortage of dwellings with high rents. In addition, current crises such as inflation and rising energy costs mean that students are competing with more and more people in search of affordable housing. As a consequence of the aforementioned developments the free choice of where to study is no longer guaranteed and thus academic freedom is at risk (Tagesspiegel, 2023). Funding for student housing is required to take the pressure off the housing market and to enable different groups of students from different social backgrounds to continue studying. To promote and open the housing market for a wide range of students, more publicly funded housing for students must be provided in the coming years. As part of the study, a quantitative survey was therefore conducted in the 22 publicly funded dormitories in Aachen on the requirements for living in a dormitory and future needs. A total of over 1,200 students took part in the 10-minute online survey. It will be found that especially after the COVID pandemic, dormitories are still a popular form of housing for students due to the large community. The survey also shows that the location requests of students are highly comparable to other housing seekers on the open market. However, few students are currently able to afford housing on the open housing market with the financial resources available to them. Although community plays an important role in students' lives, living arrangements for one to two people with their own bathroom and partial furniture are preferred. Shared rooms such as kitchens and study rooms should be available as well as sufficient storage space. Furthermore, it is apparent that, especially for students, sustainability also plays an essential role in the construction and operation of the dormitory. The paper gives first insights into the conducted investigation and context of the results and opens further discussion with other scientists on public housing.},

While many studentification studies focus on the transformation of owner-occupied houses into houses of multiple occupation, this study is about displacement in the rental housing market. I argue that within this context, the displacement of marginalised social groups takes place through rental prices and private landlords' preferences for students of higher education. Hence, I focus on how landlords extract high rents from their property without making serious investments and investigate landlords' strategies for increasing their return on investment via higher education student tenants. I explain their strategies, grounding this research in semi-structured interviews with landlords, property managers and real estate agents, complemented by statistical data. I show that different rental strategies landlords apply lead to the separation of different social groups. Hence, this paper argues that the strategies of landlords have an important impact on urban segregation and urban development in cities. Therefore, a deeper investigation of these strategies would help us achieve a better understanding of how the process of studentification proceeds and how displacement takes place.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the satisfaction of housing-related needs in single-person households across European countries. The primary objective is to assess the housing satisfaction of single-person households in European countries, specifically within the Visegrad Group. The study seeks to identify trends in housing conditions, create a ranking of countries based on these conditions, and categorize countries with similar levels of unmet housing needs. The study employs statistical measures and methods to achieve its objectives. Time series are constructed for European countries, and linear trends are analyzed to identify statistically significant changes in selected housing aspects from 2005 to 2022. Various research tasks, including ranking countries and grouping them based on housing conditions, are accomplished using established methods like linear ranking and Ward's cluster analysis. Key findings include significant variations in financial burdens related to housing costs, thermal comfort, environmental pollution, and safety issues across European countries. The study reveals both improvements and challenges in housing conditions from 2005 to 2022 in one-person households. For instance, financial stress due to housing costs decreased in some countries, while thermal comfort issues improved in several nations. The results also highlight the heterogeneity within the Visegrad Group. The study concludes that there is a need for targeted actions to address housing-related issues in single-person households. The findings underscore the importance of investments in building energy efficiency, initiatives for affordable housing construction, and environmental policies. The research emphasizes the impact of housing conditions on health, well-being, and overall community life, urging policymakers to consider these factors for holistic improvement in the housing sector.},

Losing this independence by returning to the parental home marks a regression of adult development with negative implications for returnees' subjective wellbeing. This paper investigates how a return to the parental home during the COVID-19 pandemic affects the life satisfaction of university students. We used nationwide survey data from German university students (N = 913) to analyze differences in life satisfaction for those who did or did not return to their parental homes. Our results revealed two main findings. First, university students who moved back to their parental home reported significantly lower life satisfaction than those who remained living independently. Second, the association between moving back and life satisfaction varied by age. A return to the parental home was more detrimental to older students' life satisfaction, while students aged 24 or younger did not experience a significant decrease when moving back to the parental home. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of young adults' subjective wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

For some commentators, purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) appears the panacea for studentification, as it offers the potential to reintroduce balance to studentified communities by redistributing student populations in regulated ways. This paper explores this contention, drawing upon focus groups and household surveys conducted in the vicinity of a PBSA development in Brighton, UK. The paper concludes that the location of this development in a densely populated neighbourhood has engendered adverse student/community relations, conflict, feelings of dispossession and displacement of established local residents. It is asserted that future developments of PBSA should be mindful of these issues and their implications for questions of community cohesion, quality-of-life and belonging in established residential communities. These findings are discussed in relation to debates of age differentials, segregation and new-build gentrification.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the politics of studentification in the UK. It is argued that there is a paradox between New Labour's vision of sustainable communities and the geographical effects of the promotion of higher education---in a similar vein to policies to generate `positive' gentrification. This contention hinges on the absence of a national policy on the supply of student housing, which dictates how enlarged student populations should be integrated into established communities, or dispersed to other parts of towns and cities. It is asserted that the lack of government policy and the incapacity of institutional actors to intervene or regulate the residential geographies of students are yielding `unbalanced' populations. This is a factor in the rise of studentification and the fragmentation of established communities. Ironically, some activists argue these `lost' communities signified lucid exemplars that the sustainable communities policy seeks to engender. These new geographies also obscure the positives of a student population and may foster resentment and conflict between students and established residents. More specifically, the paper illustrates how debates of planning and housing legislation are integral for addressing the challenges of studentification. The paper concludes by considering some possible lessons of studentification for mitigating the negatives of gentrification.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research is to study the feeling of safety of international students in Groningen, with a focus on the housing situation and community integration. The feeling of safety is how comfortable a person is in a certain place. Factors like stress, bad housing quality or loneliness could potentially negatively impact the feeling of safety. The housing situation can be influential as there are high levels of stress apparent when international students are trying to find a room in Groningen, and when they are residing in emergency housing. The community integration can influence the feeling of safety as students can feel more comfortable when the people around them are familiar although language differences can have a negative influence. This research answers the following question; How does the housing situation and community integration of international students in Groningen contribute to their feeling of safety? This has been answered through a qualitative research method by conducting 18 interviews with international students living, or having recently lived, in Groningen. The housing crisis has had a big impact on international students, who have possibly been the biggest losers in this crisis. They are unable to find a room and are often forced in emergency housing. Competition is high and so are stress levels. This culminates in a decrease in study results, and a negative impact on the experience in Groningen. The study concludes with a relation between the housing situation of international students and their feeling of safety, being negatively impacted by discrimination, emergency housing and stress. There is little contribution of community integration to the feeling of safety.},

Design/methodology/approach               A quantitative survey was conducted in the 21 publicly funded dormitories in Aachen (Germany) in 2022 to determine students' needs and preferences for housing. In total, more than 1,200 students participated in the 10-min online survey.                                         Findings               The findings show the needs and preferences of students from different financial backgrounds for various areas in the dormitory. These include the location of the dormitory, the outdoor area, the shared spaces, the sanitary facilities (bathroom and kitchen), and the students' private rooms. The results are divided into needs that all students have regardless of their financial background (``must-haves'') and needs that correspond to individual financial groups (``nice-to-haves'').                                         Research limitations/implications               The results relate to the medium-sized city of Aachen as a case study in Germany -- with an average rent level -- and its urban situation. The outcomes are therefore only transferable to a limited extent to cities with different framework conditions, as the needs and preferences of students may differ.

The first is Immeo Wohnen, a subsidiary of the French real estate investment trust (REIT) Fonci{\`e}re des R{\'e}gions that was previously owned by a US hedge fund. The second is Vonovia, Germany's largest real estate company, originally a subsidiary of a British private equity firm. Both examples embody what we call the shift from financialisation 1.0 to financialisation 2.0, i.e. the transition from pure speculation to long-term investment. We show that long-term investment strategies are used by REITs and listed funds in order to release housing into the privatised mainstream of capital accumulation. With the advent of the financialisation of rental housing 2.0, the long-term investment focus of these funds paradoxically enables a short-term investment focus by buying and selling shares in these funds on the stock exchange.           ,              Kurzfassung             In diesem Beitrag werden zwei im Ruhrgebiet t{\"a}tige b{\"o}rsennotierte Wohnungsgesellschaften in den Blick genommen.

On the one hand, we test whether neighbourhoods with a good accessibility are more attractive and consequently show higher housing prices. For this purpose, we introduce an adapted Walk Score as part of the accessibility indicators. On the other hand, we compare an ordinary-least-squares regression (OLS) and a spatial lag model and test which model better explains residential housing prices. The regression models show the importance of classical factors such as dwelling characteristics or the types of neighbours. In addition, they also reveal that adifferentiated approach is needed for analysing the accessibility, the location and the environment of a dwelling. The mere presence of a single amenity, a public transport stop or a motorway access is not a sufficient explanatory factor. Information such as density of supply, walking distances or public transport service quality needs to be taken into account as well as. The test of the spatial lag model reveals that prices of the most proximate dwellings can be taken into account as a relevant factor in explaining residential housing prices and should therefore be included in research on residential housing prices.},

The data stem from an online survey among a~random sample of the population of a~mid-sized German city. In a~vignette experiment, respondents were asked to rate example residential settings with respect to their attractiveness. The settings varied regarding the ethnic and religious composition of the neighborhood and other neighborhood characteristics that are positively or negatively related to residential attractiveness.             We find that respondents have discriminatory residential preferences toward migrants and the presence of a~Muslim community in the neighborhood. One-half of the migrant effect is mitigated if other positively connoted residential characteristics exist. We take this as an indication for statistical discrimination. This does not hold for the ``Muslim community'' effect. Discrimination gets stronger with higher levels of perceived economic group-threat from migrants. We further find evidence for a~cultural group-threat and for the contact hypothesis: religious people are more discriminatory than nonreligious people, and real-life contact with migrants entails less discrimination.           ,              Zusammenfassung             Der Beitrag untersucht Entstehungsmechanismen residentieller Segregation f{\"u}r die Nachfrageseite von Wohnungsm{\"a}rkten, d.\,h. diskriminierende Wohnpr{\"a}ferenzen von Einwohnern bez{\"u}glich der sozialen Zusammensetzung von Wohnvierteln. Analysiert werden Daten eines Online-Surveys unter einer Zufallsstichprobe von Bewohnern einer mittelgro{\ss}en deutschen Stadt. In einem Vignettenexperiment bewerteten die Befragten beispielhafte Wohnumgebungen hinsichtlich ihrer allgemeinen Attraktivit{\"a}t. Die Wohnumgebungen variierten nach ethnischen und religi{\"o}sen Merkmalen der fiktiven Bewohner sowie nach weiteren Merkmalen, welche die Attraktivit{\"a}t der Wohnsituationen positiv oder negativ beeinflussen.             Im Ergebnis zeigen sich diskriminierende Wohnpr{\"a}ferenzen gegen{\"u}ber Migranten und der Pr{\"a}senz einer muslimischen Gemeinde in der Nachbarschaft. Sofern weitere positiv konnotierte Wohnmerkmale vorliegen, reduziert sich der negative Migranteneffekt um etwa die H{\"a}lfte. Dies spricht f{\"u}r statistische Diskriminierung als Wirkmechanismus. F{\"u}r den Effekt einer muslimischen Gemeinde gilt dies indes nicht. Weiterhin zeigen wir, dass Diskriminierung mit zunehmender wahrgenommener {\"o}konomischer Gruppenbedrohung zunimmt und sich Hinweise f{\"u}r die kulturelle Gruppenbedrohungsthese und die Kontakthypothese finden: Religi{\"o}se Menschen diskriminieren mehr als nichtreligi{\"o}se und tats{\"a}chlicher allt{\"a}glicher Kontakt zu Migranten verringert diskriminierende Wohnpr{\"a}ferenzen.},
