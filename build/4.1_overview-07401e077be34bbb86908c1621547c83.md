# 4.1 Overview 

While the previous chapters described and examined the components of student housing and the market relationships between them, this chapter focuses on the users of student accommodations.

# What? Students Behind the Numbers

Behind the student housing crisis numbers there are actual users. In order to rethink the housing crisis, it is necessary not only to assess the student housing market, but also to address users—customers—directly. 

The first attempt to understand users was made in the chapter on defining `demand`. It is worth remembering that for this research, the target group is international students enrolled in Berlin's higher education institutions, at any level, regardless of current residency. However, `international students` themselves do not represent a homogeneous group, but rather a multitude of disparate qualitative groups that differ from each other in terms of housing needs and preferences. 

This chapter helps to get to know `international students` as users in more detail. 

# Why? Bridge Demand and Supply 

The aim of this chapter is to define users and assess user experience by answering the following research questions:

**Who are the users of student accommodations?**

**What experience they have in ongoing housing crisis? What are common needs, preferences, difficulties and problems?**

The answers to these questions can be used in developing strategies to improve the situation on the student housing market and bridge demand and supply.

# How? Behavioral Studies 

This chapter was written in collaboration with Joseph Kampfmann as part of the preparations for the ENHANCE workshop Perspectives on the European Student Accommodation Crisis, which was organised by Hannah Berner and Jesco Lippke.

**Surveys, Questionnaires, Interviews**     
Surveys, questionnaires, and interviews are traditional behavioral study methods widely used to collect data on people’s opinions, attitudes, and behavior. To improve the accuracy and relevance of the results, it is important not to generalise students but to divide them into qualitative groups. This takes into account the diversity of their needs and preferences, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomena under study.

**Storytelling & Narrative Analysis**   
Storytelling & Narrative Analysis can be seen as an alternative method of behavioral studies that allows the exploration of participants’ personal stories and experiences, revealing the emotional and social aspects of their behavior (Riessman, 2008). Although this method differs from an overall data-driven approach, it makes it difficult to automate data analysis. Nevertheless, individual experiences are important for understanding hidden barriers to finding student housing, cultural sensitivity, and adaptation in a new city.

Future-proof urban solutions require collaborative planning, where city authorities, public and private investors, and citizens act together.
